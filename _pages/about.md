This is my attempt to document things that I find interesting in the area of statistics, optimization, probability, machine learning, programming. The blog pages are likely to have some issues,
hopefully, minor. For example, currently the latex equations are not properly rendering. If there are easy ways to fix them, I happy to address it. Otherwise, we will have to live with these
imperfections. The best rendering of the posts can be got by looking at the original notebook available [here](https://github.com/vijayvd/vijayvd.github.io/tree/master/_jupyter).
